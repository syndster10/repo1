<p>Swans are the largest extant members of the waterfowl family Anatidae and are among the largest flying birds. 
The largest living species, including the mute swan, trumpeter swan, and whooper swan, can 
  reach a length of over 1.5 m (59 in) and weigh over 15 kg (33 lb). Their wingspans can be over 3.1 m (10 ft). 
  Compared to the closely related geese, they are much larger and have proportionally larger feet and necks. 
  Adults also have a patch of unfeathered skin between the eyes and bill. The sexes are alike in plumage, but males are generally bigger and heavier than females. 
  The biggest species of swan ever was the extinct Cygnus falconeri, a flightless giant swan known from fossils found on the Mediterranean islands of Malta and Sicily. 
  Its disappearance is thought to have resulted from extreme climate fluctuations or the arrival of superior predators and competitors.</p>
